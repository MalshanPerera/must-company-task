# macOS Timer Application

The macOS Timer Application is a versatile tool designed to automate the process of capturing a headshot and taking a screenshot after a specified timer duration. This application is particularly useful for scenarios that require automated documentation or periodic visual records.

## Key Features

1. **Timer Functionality**

   - The application enables users to set a timer. When the timer reaches zero, it triggers the camera to capture a headshot.

2. **Automated Headshot Capture**

   - At the end of the timer, the application automatically captures a headshot using the device's camera. The captured image is then displayed within the application for immediate review.

3. **Screenshot Capture and Save**
   - Following the headshot capture, the application takes a screenshot of the current screen. This screenshot is automatically saved in the user's Downloads folder for easy access and reference.

## Future Work

1. **Cross-Platform Implementation**

   - Currently, the application is only available for macOS. Future development will focus on extending support to other platforms such as Windows and Linux, ensuring a broader user base can benefit from its features.

2. **Bug Fixes and Improvements**
   - Given time limitations, there may be bugs or edge cases that have not been fully addressed. Future updates can focus on identifying and fixing any bugs, enhancing stability, and improving overall user experience.

We welcome any feedback or bug reports to help improve the application. Thank you for using the macOS Timer Application.
